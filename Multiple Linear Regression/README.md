# Linear-Regression-Analysis-with-Business-Problem

we will analyse a business problem with Multiple linear regression in a step by step manner and try to interpret the statistical terms at each step to understand its inner workings.

Dataset
we are using Advertisement dataset Let's consider there is a company and it has to improve the sales of product. The company spends money on different advertising media such as TV, radio, and newspaper to increase the sales of its products. The company records the money spent on each advertising media (in thousands of dollars) and the number of units of product sold (in thousands of units). Now we have to help the company to find out the most effective way to spend money on advertising media to improve sales for the next year with a less advertising budget
